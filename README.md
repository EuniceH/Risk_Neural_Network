# Project Title


The credit risk resampling is a python jupyter lab interface program.  It  uses various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. It uses a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) - It's a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) - For Series, DataFrame, and plots

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - For adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
