# Project Title


The risk neural network is a python jupyter lab interface program.  It sets neural network/machine learning models for startup success prediction.


## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) - It's a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) - For Series, DataFrame, and plots

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - For adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - For Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python) For neurual network modeling.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install jupyterlab
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

## Usage

To use the credit risk resampling, simply clone the risk_nn from the respository, open jupyter lab and open **venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb** with:

```python
jupyter lab
```

Re-run the jupyter book to produce learning prediction.
